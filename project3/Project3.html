  <div class="text">

  <div id="line1">
<br>Standing in front of the door
<br>Shaking, restless
<br>Smelling the aromatic cooked animals
<br>Enticing my tastebuds
<br>Tempting my mental 
<br>Questioning morals
<br>And burning the construct
<br>Of how we perceive 
<span id="next"><a href="page2.html">life</a></span> <br>and <span id="next"> <a href="page3.html">death.</a></span></div>

 <div id="line2">
  <br>They talk behind the door
<br>Voices lacking the questions
<br>Empty of empathy
<br>And void of truth.
<br>They fall into <span id="next"><a href="page4.html"> the matrix.</a></span> 
<br>They say “live the life you love!”
<br>But do they love the life they are living?
<br>Are they aware of the invisible blood
<br>Seeping from their very <span id="next"><a href="page5.html">teeth</a>?</span></div>

 <div id="line3">
<br>The smell of <span id="next"><a href="page6.html">murder</a></span>
<br>Is masked with garlic and thyme
<br>And invites me in
<br>Like the devil 
<br>Enticing me to his yearly dance
<br>Of oppressive <span id="next"><a href="page7.html">punishment.</a></span></div>

 <div id="line4">
<br>The voices plunge into my throat
<br>And take away what I value the most. 
<br>They <span id="next"><a href="page8.html">impregnate their unwanted opinions</a></span>
<br>Questions
<br>Stereotypes 
<br>Concerns
<br>Values
<br>Traditions
<br>Religion
<br>And culture
<br>Into my space.
<br>Intoxicating my <span id="next"><a href="page9.html">peace</a></span>
<br>And enclosing my sanity.</div>

 <div id="line5">
<br>The blood flows
<br>From my triggered heart
<br>Yet is perceived as a <span id="next"><a href="page10.html">laughing matter</a></span>
<br>It is dismissed
<br>It is shut out
<br>It is <span id="next"><a href="page11.html">questioned </a></span>
<br>In projected insecurity
<br>Yet it remains.</div>
